Hi - I'm Anton - the developer of this site (and many others)!
<br/>
<p>
I'm a third-year computing science student at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, B.C., and I've been working as a web developer since 2021.
<p/>
<p>
In addition to studying at SFU, I do event photography and external relations for <a href="https://sfusurge.com/">SFU Surge</a>, where I participated in making
our flagship event, <a href="https://www.stormhacks.com/">StormHacks</a> becoming Western Canada's biggest hackathon, with over 1000 applicants and over 750 participants.
<p/>
<p>
I'm currently working at a local startup as a full-stack (React + MUI + Koa) developer on a marketplace-based anti-scalping event ticketing service, and a GIS web app for free-form user-generated-content placement over a map of Earth.
<br/>
<p/>
<p>
Outisde of school and work, I spend my free time tinkering with old tech, working on cars and
