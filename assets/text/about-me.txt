Hi! I'm Anton - the developer of this site!

I'm a third-year CompSci student at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, B.C., and I've been working as a full-stack React web developer since 2021.

In addition to studying at SFU, I'm a member of <a href="https://sfusurge.com/">SFU Surge</a>, one of SFU's top tech-focused student organisations,
as a Photographer and External Eelations Coordinator since September 2024.

My current focus, and largest project to-date, is TicketRebel - an event ticketing website designed for small-scale events, such as block parties and underground music shows.
At the moment, myself and the two other members of the project are doing market research, and designing the API and database models.

<br/>
