Hi! I'm Anton - the developer of this site!
<br>
I'm a third-year student at Simon Fraser University, in Vancouver, B.C., studying Computing Science.
<br>
I've been working as a full-stack web developer since 2021, with my main focus being React-based websites,
including single-page invoice generators, concert ticketing websites and everything in between.
<br>
In addition to studying at SFU, I am an active member of <a href="https://sfusurge.com/">SFU Surge</a>, my university's
largest student-led tech-focused organisation, where I have held the position of photographer/social media executive
since September 2024.
<br>
I spend my free time listening to music (I'm particularly fond of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap0mqwvf7H0">Taking Back Sunday</a> and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTu269qSnw">Porter Robinson</a>), and tinkering with technology.
From engines to film cameras - if I can get my hands on it, chances are that it will be taken apart at some point.
