Hi - I'm Anton - the developer of this site (and many others)!
<br/>
I'm a third-year computing science student at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, B.C., and I've been working as a Full-Stack React developer since 2021.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to studying at SFU, I do event photography and external relations for <a href="https://sfusurge.com/">SFU Surge</a>, where I participated in making
our flagship event, <a href="https://www.stormhacks.com/">StormHacks</a>becoming Western Canada's biggest hackathon, with over 1000 applicants and over 750 participants.
<br/>

I'm currently working for a local startup, where I'm working on an anti-scalping event-ticketing service and a GIS web app for free-form user-generated-content placement over a map of Earth.
<br/>
<br/>
