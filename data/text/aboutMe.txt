Hi! I'm Anton - the developer of this site!
<br>
I'm a third-year at Simon Fraser University, in Vancouver, B.C., studying Computing Science.
<br>
I've been working as a full-stack web developer for the past ${yearsSinceHighSchool()} years, since before I even finished high school.
<br>
In addition to English, I speak fluent Russian, having spoken it at home my entire life, and French, from participating in
the French Immersion Program throughout my entire K-12 schooling.
<br>
I have a passion for anything old and outdated, especially anything from the Y2K era like classic iPods, digicams and CDs,
which I heavily use as inspiration in my work.
<br>
I have been a member of <a href="https://sfusurge.com/">SFU Surge</a>, my university's largest student-led tech-focused organisation,
since September 2024, and currently hold the position of photographer/social media executive.
